Nowadays, there are restrictions on data to cross national boundaries to preserve privacy and uphold national security. However, to ensure quick access, data centers are spread across multiple nations in order to reside data as close to the end users as possible. On top of this, rapid growth and ubiquitous generation of data are causing big data becoming both tall and wide. In these new settings, analytic techniques like \emph{PCA} are seeing a new set of challenges. In terms of computational and communicational complexities, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) holds significantly higher efficiency. It also has some major advantages over other techniques such as set up a probabilistic model and ability to handle missing data which is highly advantageous in case of geographically sparse data. Unfortunately currently we posses no suitable method to calculate \emph{PPCA} on geographically distributed big data which is both tall and wide. In this paper, we propose a new approach to handle tall and wide big data in case of performing \emph{PPCA} in a single data cluster (or  a simple commodity computer) and accumulate the intermediate results to generate the final one. Moreover we  provide an implementation for it. We hope our work has a great potential in popularizing \textit{PPCA} as an practical analytical tool for big data by eliminating the dimensional and geographical restrictions and thus holds a significant promise in this premise.
