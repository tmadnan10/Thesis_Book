First of all, we would like to express our gratitude to our supervisor Assistant Professor Dr. Muhammad Abdullah Adnan for introducing us to the large world of Machine Learning and Big Data and for showing us the appropriate approach to science. We thank him for his patience in times of our countless missteps, support in our work, excellent advices and constant supervision. Especially, his encouragement in our tough days was invaluable. 

We also express our gratitude to Md. Mehrab Tanjim to help us in enormous ways. Without him it would not be possible to do the hard works.

We would also like to express our utmost gratitude to Professor Dr. M. Sohel Rahman, Head, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BUET, for the provision of laboratory facilities. 

Finally, we would like to acknowledge the help and support of members of our research group.
